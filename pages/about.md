Nice to meet you! My name is Abbey and I am the author of *a crumb*. *a crumb* is rooted in my curiosity and commitment to discovering sustainable harmony between society and the environment. Take a crumb or leave a crumb in our journey to better understand our role and opportunity to live alongside the natural world.

I am a PhD student studying how carbon moves among and through forest systems. As a member of the University of Miami Biology Department, I investigate global questions in carbon cycling, forest systems, and decomposition. While the scientific process guides a lot of my thinking as a student, I am curious as to how we can expand science past publications, journals, and datasets. Science communication has an ever-important role in modern society, and I hope that some of the thoughts placed here on *a crumb* can begin to bridge the gap between citizens and the scientific world. 

Outside of my PhD research and blog writing, I am an outdoor enthusiast, as growing up in Ithaca, NY pushed me to always explore the best hidden hiking and swimming spots with my dog Zoe (pictured below). I love waterfalls, dogs, and baking bread, but more than anything I love sharing with others my passion for the natural world. Additionally, at Cornell I competed as a varsity student-athlete on the track and field team, specializing in the 400 meter hurdles. After 10+ years of competitive racing, I continue to love running, but have shifted my focus to explore more creative movements in my yoga practice. 

I hope this blog conveys the endless opportunities that we have to lead a more sustainable lifestyle. After all, like any in any learning, the path taken far outweighs the lesson learned by simply arriving at your destination.
